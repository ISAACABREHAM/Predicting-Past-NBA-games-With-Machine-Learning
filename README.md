# Predicting-Past-NBA-games-With-Machine-Learning
The porject i've created focuses on predicting NBA game outcomes using machine learning techniques. The data preprocessing phase involves cleaning and organizing the dataset, including removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.

The machine learning portion uses a Ridge Classifier and Sequential Feature Selector to select relevant features for prediction. The model is then evaluated using a time-series cross-validation approach to assess its performance in predicting game outcomes. The accuracy of the model is calculated, and additional features, such as a 10-day rolling average, are incorporated to enhance predictive capabilities.

The code concludes by generating final predictions and assessing the accuracy of the model. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a practical application of machine learning in predicting NBA game outcomes, providing insights into the factors that influence team performance. Feel free to explore and adapt the code to enhance the model or apply it to other sports datasets.
